# Ulta_bot

I created an Ulta-bot to track sales in the Ulta store and send sale notifications to the Telegram account.

The bot has a simple UI interface where a user can add, delete, or track the current price and sale price (if available) of the product. I deployed my app on a Linux-based server to check each item's price every 12 hours. If there is a sale on Ulta's website, the program adds the sale price to the sale column in the table and sends a sale notification to the Telegram account.

To add a new product, it's required to enter the link to the desired product found on the Ulta website. After clicking the "Submit" button, the user is redirected to a page where they are asked if they want to add this product.

If the "Yes" button is clicked, a notification is automatically sent to the user's Telegram account.

To delete an item from the table, the user has to click the "delete" button in the delete table.

After that, a delete notification is sent to the Telegram account, and the item is removed from the table.
